#Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a 
program

In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes. They are used to define the structure and logic of a program. Here are some examples of predefined keywords in Python and how they are used:

1. if, else, elif: Used for conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

Example:

x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")


1. for, while: Used for loops to iterate over sequences or execute code repeatedly.

Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


1. def: Used to define functions, which are reusable blocks of code.

Example:

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("John")


1. class: Used to define classes, which are templates for creating objects.

Example:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print("My name is " + self.name + " and I am " + str(self.age) + " years old.")

person = Person("John", 30)
person.introduce()


1. try, except: Used for exception handling to catch and handle errors.

Example:

try:
    x = 5 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")


1. import: Used to import modules, which are pre-written code libraries.

Example:

import math
print(math.pi)


1. return: Used to exit a function and return a value.

Example:

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)

#Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples

Here's a comparison of mutable and immutable objects in Python:

Mutable Objects

- Can be changed after creation
- Modify the original object
- Examples: lists, dictionaries, sets, user-defined classes

Example:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]


Immutable Objects

- Cannot be changed after creation
- Create a new object when modified
- Examples: integers, floats, strings, tuples

Example:

my_string = "hello"
my_string += " world"
print(my_string)  # Output: "hello world"


# Creates a new string object, doesn't modify the original


Key differences:

- Mutable objects can be modified in-place, while immutable objects create a new object when modified.
- Mutable objects can be changed after creation, while immutable objects cannot.
- Mutable objects are generally more memory-efficient, as they don't require creating new objects when modified.

Examples of mutable and immutable objects:

- Mutable:
    - Lists: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    - Dictionaries: my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    - Sets: my_set = {1, 2, 3}
- Immutable:
    - Integers: my_int = 5
    - Floats: my_float = 3.14
    - Strings: my_string = "hello"
    - Tuples: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

#Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used

In Python, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. There are several types of operators in Python, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
    - Addition: a + b
    - Subtraction: a - b
    - Multiplication: a * b
    - Division: a / b
    - Modulus (remainder): a % b
    - Exponentiation: a ** b

Example: x = 5; y = 3; print(x + y) # Output: 8

1. Comparison Operators:
    - Equal: a == b
    - Not Equal: a != b
    - Greater Than: a > b
    - Less Than: a < b
    - Greater Than or Equal: a >= b
    - Less Than or Equal: a <= b

Example: x = 5; y = 3; print(x > y) # Output: True

1. Logical Operators:
    - And: a and b
    - Or: a or b
    - Not: not a

Example: x = True; y = False; print(x and y) # Output: False

1. Assignment Operators:
    - Assign: a = b
    - Add and Assign: a += b
    - Subtract and Assign: a -= b
    - Multiply and Assign: a *= b
    - Divide and Assign: a /= b

Example: x = 5; x += 3; print(x) # Output: 8

1. Membership Operators:
    - In: a in b
    - Not In: a not in b

Example: fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']; print('apple' in fruits) # Output: True

1. Identity Operators:
    - Is: a is b
    - Is Not: a is not b

Example: x = 5; y = 5; print(x is y) # Output: True

1. Bitwise Operators:
    - And: a & b
    - Or: a | b
    - Xor: a ^ b
    - Not: ~a
    - Left Shift: a << b
    - Right Shift: a >> b

Example: x = 5; y = 3; print(x & y) # Output: 1

These are the main types of operators in Python. Each operator has its own specific use case and can be used to perform various operations on variables and values.

#Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples


Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is also known as type conversion. Python has built-in functions to convert between data types.

Here are some examples of type casting in Python:

1. Integer to Float
    - int_var = 10
    - float_var = float(int_var)
    - print(float_var)  # Output: 10.0

2. Float to Integer
    - float_var = 10.5
    - int_var = int(float_var)
    - print(int_var)  # Output: 10

3. String to Integer
    - str_var = "10"
    - int_var = int(str_var)
    - print(int_var)  # Output: 10

4. Integer to String
    - int_var = 10
    - str_var = str(int_var)
    - print(str_var)  # Output: "10"

5. String to Float
    - str_var = "10.5"
    - float_var = float(str_var)
    - print(float_var)  # Output: 10.5

6. Float to String
    - float_var = 10.5
    - str_var = str(float_var)
    - print(str_var)  # Output: "10.5"

7. Boolean to Integer
    - bool_var = True
    - int_var = int(bool_var)
    - print(int_var)  # Output: 1

8. Boolean to String
    - bool_var = True
    - str_var = str(bool_var)
    - print(str_var)  # Output: "True"

#How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples

Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are also known as decision-making statements. Here's how they work:

1. If Statement:
    - If a condition is true, execute the code block.
    - Syntax: if condition: code_block

Example:

x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
# Output: x is less than or equal to 10


1. If-Else Statement:
    - If a condition is true, execute the first code block; otherwise, execute the second code block.
    - Syntax: if condition: code_block1 else: code_block2

Example:

x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
# Output: x is less than or equal to 10


1. If-Elif-Else Statement:
    - If the first condition is true, execute the first code block; otherwise, check the second condition, and so on.
    - Syntax: if condition1: code_block1 elif condition2: code_block2 else: code_block3

Example:

x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
# Output: x is equal to 5


1. Nested If Statements:
    - If statements can be nested inside each other.
    - Syntax: if condition1: if condition2: code_block

Example:

x = 5
y = 3
if x > 10:
    if y > 2:
        print("x is greater than 10 and y is greater than 2")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 10 but y is not greater than 2")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
# Output: x is not greater than 10


1. Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):
    - A concise way to write simple if-else statements.
    - Syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

Example:

x = 5
result = "x is greater than 10" if x > 10 else "x is less than or equal to 10"
print(result)
# Output: x is less than or equal to 10


These are the basic conditional statements in Python. They help control the flow of your program based on conditions.


# Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.

Python has two primary types of loops: for loops and while loops. Each serves a distinct purpose and is suited for specific use cases.

1. For Loops

for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers.

- Syntax: for variable in iterable: code_block

Example:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry


Use cases:

- Iterating over a list or tuple
- Iterating over a string (characters)
- Iterating over a dictionary (keys or values)

2. While Loops

while loops are used to execute a code block as long as a condition is true.

- Syntax: while condition: code_block

Example:

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4


Use cases:

- Repeating a task until a condition is met
- Reading input until a specific condition is met
- Simulating a do-while loop (using while True and break)

3. Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside each other to perform more complex iterations.

Example:

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
# Output:
# i: 0, j: 0
# i: 0, j: 1
# i: 1, j: 0
# i: 1, j: 1
# i: 2, j: 0
# i: 2, j: 1


Use cases:

- Iterating over a 2D array or matrix
- Performing multiple iterations over different sequences

4. Loop Control Statements

- break: Exits the loop prematurely
- continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
- pass: Does nothing (used as a placeholder)

Example:

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2



- for loops are ideal for iterating over sequences or ranges.
- while loops are suitable for repeating tasks until a condition is met.
- Nested loops are useful for complex iterations.
- Loop control statements help manage the flow of loops.
